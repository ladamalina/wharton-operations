While idle time is an important and obvious waste of capacity, it is not
the only enemy of a lean operation. Academics like me, like the problems of
line balancing and staffing to demand, driving out the idle time to tact
time given the processing times. Because these are very well
defined problems that lead to very elegant mathematical formulations. In practice, however, often times an even
bigger lever for productivity improvement is going after the variation of
processing times across workers. Just like you and
I work differently in our ability to sing, in our speed with which we are going to
run five or ten kilometers, you and I will differ in the processing time that
it would take us to make a sandwich. Addressing this variation
across workers and processing time,
is the idea behind standardization. Teaching observation the way that
Frederick Winslow Taylor did it is hard in an academic course. For this reason, I find that many
academic courses are biased towards the mathematical treatment of
productivity but really miss out on some great insights that can be
obtained by going to the front line. To address this challenge
in academic courses, I've prepared two calls that were made
to a large call center of a retail bank. Both callers are about making deposits
to a mortgage account via a credit card, but the two calls are handled
by different operators, who, as you will notice, have slightly
different ways of handling the call. At this point, I would like you
to take out a stopwatch and carefully listen to what
happened in the calls. Just go through the call,
step by step, and take notice of how much time
is spent on the various tasks. Are you ready? Here we go. >> Hello.
You're speaking to David. Can I have your name please? >> Yes.
It's Natalie Walker. >> Good morning.
How can I help you today, Ms. Walker? I'm calling because I'd like to
make a payment to my account. Can you do that? >> No problem. Can you give me the seven digit mortgage
account number, starting with BCC? >> Yes, it is B, C, C, six, five, eight. >> B, C, C, six, five, eight. >> Two, three, one, four. >> Two, three, one, four. >> Yes.
>> Thank you, Ms Walker. I just need to ask you some
basic security questions. >> Okay, that's fine. >> Can you give me the first line of
your address and the post code, please? >> It is 48 Church Road, Bolton,
and the post code is BO38FD. >> Thank you. And your date of birth, please? >> Seventh of March, 1979. >> Thank you.
And what amount would you like to pay? >> 500 pounds, please. >> Would you like to pay by debit or
credit card? >> Credit card. >> Okay.
And is it Amex, Visa, or MasterCard? >> MasterCard. >> Thank you. Can I take the sixteen digit code
on the middle of the card, please? >> Five, five, nine, o.
>> Five, five, nine, o. >> Seven, one, four, three. >> Seven, one, four, three. >> Eight, nine, seven, three. >> Eight, nine, seven, three. >> Six, three, two, two. >> Six, three, two, two. >> Correct. >> Thank you. And the expiry date? >> O, three, thirteen.
>> Thank you. And the full name on the card, please. >> Jess Natalie Walker. Thank you. And the three digit code
at the back of the card? >> Four, eight, five. >> Four, eight, five. Bare with me while
the payment goes through. Thank you. Your payment has gone through. >> Thank you. >> Thank you for calling. Is there anything else I
can help you with today? >> No, I think that was all. I will need to make a change later,
but I will do that on a later date. So no, that will be all for now. >> Okay. Thank you.
Good bye. >> Hello, you're speaking to Anna, can I
have your mortgage account number please? >> Yes, it's B,C, C, seven, five, seven. >> Yeah.
>> One, nine, five, eight. >> Thank you. Can you confirm your name, please? >> Scott Jones. >> Thank you, Mr. Jones. I just need to ask you some
basic security questions. >> Okay.
That's fine. >> Can you give me the first line of
your address and the postcode, please? >> It's The Boathouse, 58 Green Lane,
and the post code is TN73CA. >> Thank you. And your date of birth, please. >> 27th of September, 1981. >> Thank you.
And how can I help you today? >> I'm looking to make a payment
into my account, please. >> No problem. What amount would you like to pay? >> 750 pounds. >> And would you like to pay by debit or
credit card? >> Credit card, please. >> And is that Amex, VISA, or MasterCard? >> VISA. >> Thank you. Can I take the 16-digit code on the card,
please? >> Two, two, five, six. >> Yeah. >> Four, zero, eight, zero. >> Yeah. >> One, two, five, three. >> Yeah. >> Five, eight, seven, nine. >> Thank you, and the expiry date. >> Four, twelve.
>> And the full name on the card, please. >> Scott Jones. >> And the three digit code
at the back of the card. >> One, five, three.
>> Thank you. Your payment has just gone through. >> Thank you. >> Thank you for calling. Goodbye. >> So, what did you notice? Who was faster? Who was the better employee? Which of those two employees do
you want to have work for you? If the only enemy that we consider in our
study of productivity is idle time, we're missing a big opportunity that resides
in the processing times themselves. Referred to the first extra words
that the first operator was using as unnecessary motion. Though in our case,
this really means unnecessary talking. To analyze such variation in processing
times across operators, I find it is helpful to just collect a sample of
processing times for each operator. The average processing time of
process operators will vary. Instead of simply comparing the best
operator and the worst operator based on the averages, I, in this picture show
what's called a Quartile Analysis. The Quartile Analysis compares
the highest quartile performing operator, that means the operator was still 25%
other operators that are faster than him or her, with the bottom quarter operator,
i.e.the operator who has 75% of the other operators faster,
and 25% slower. In this slide, I do this for
two tasks that exist in a large bank in the underwriting operation for
consumer loans. You see on the right of the slide
the closing step for this activity. For closing there are a couple
of rather clergical and manual tasks that need to happen and
if you observe, a very, very tiny difference between the top quartile and
the bottom quartile performer. On the left, you look at
the underwriting function itself. For underwriters, the gap between
the top performer and the bottom performer varies dramatically for
the selected set of activities shown here. So it is interesting that actually in
the more knowledge intense activities the variation in productivity
is more dramatic. In a recent study of over 100,000 patients
that were treated in the emergency room of three hospitals, my colleagues and I wanted to investigate to
what extent productivity, in the form of processing times,
would differ in healthcare settings. The 100,000 patients were
seen over multiple years by a group of some eighty doctors and
over 100 nurses. The results were very similar to what
we just saw in the banking settings. We saw about a 260% difference
between the 10th quartile and the 90th percent quartile operators. Again, we see dramatic productivity
effects, not coming from idle time, but by looking at processing
time across operators. After 300%, the variation that we saw in
today's class between the top performing employees and the low performing employees
in the service operations were enormous. Call center, bank, hospital,
service employees, manufacturing employees, everyone
differs according to their productivity. Reducing these productivity gaps
between the top quarter and the bottom quarter employees provides
an enormous financial opportunity. Typically, if we can transfer
the best practices from the top performers to
the bottom performers, the average productivity is
going to be lifted upwards. This should motivate you to
go out to the front line and follow the footsteps of
Frederick Winslow Taylor. Go out and measure yourself. Measure these productivity times because,
typically, this is not data that most
organizations currently have available. Then, take this data,
plot it, compare the top and the bottom quartile and you get a sense
of the variation in the process. Again, anything you can do to reduce this
variation by moving the bottom quartile up to the median or to the top quartile, will
give you an enormous productivity boost.

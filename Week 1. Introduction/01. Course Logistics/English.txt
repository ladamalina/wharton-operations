This is a four-week-long course designed
to give you the foundations of operations management. The course is organized in
a series of four modules. The first module is the introduction. Second module introduces process analysis as the academic framework
to analyze an operation. The third module covers productivity. That is all about using
the resources of the process wisely. And then the last module covers quality. Quality is about meeting
the requirements of our customers. So that you can get quick feedback
on how you're doing in my course, I've created a set of
homework assignments. We also post some practice problems and
some review sessions at the end of each module that allow you to
get ready for the final exam. The final exam allows you to demonstrate
what you have learned in this course. Grading details and other course logistics
will be posted on the course website. We are also posting more resources
that you can use before and during the final exam. I will be in touch once a week
with some email announcements I also want to invite you to participate
in the various online forum activities. That's it for now. Let's get ready for the course. Welcome to Operations Management.
